# CLASS: InteractivePlayer

# Author: Risto Zimbakov, 7841204
#
# REMARKS: The human player class should prompt the user for information. For instance, the method canAnswer
# should show the human player the current guess and the current index i, show the player
# the cards they have that they can show player i, and then ask which card they wish to show.
# The program is not responsible for managing the human playerâ€™s deduction
